Adds patch `worker_feat_add_hook_to_notify_script_ready.patch` that explains the root cause of this issue, I am gonna try upstreaming this, will see how it goes. The access to global properties from Node.js happens in `node::MaybeInitializeContext` which modifies the global object for primordials.\r\n\r\n**Part II: Cannot load worker scripts over custom protocol**\r\n\r\nAfter https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1798250 we need to explicitly register custom URLLoaderFactories for dedicated/shared workers.\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] PR description included and stakeholders cc'd\r\n- [ ] `npm test` passes\r\n- [ ] tests are [changed or added](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/testing.md)\r\n- [ ] relevant documentation is changed or added\r\n- [x] PR title follows semantic [commit guidelines](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/pull-requests.md#commit-message-guidelines)\r\n- [x] [PR release notes](https://github.com/electron/clerk/blob/master/README.md) describe the change in a way relevant to app developers, and are [capitalized, punctuated, and past tense](https://github.com/electron/clerk/blob/master/README.md#examples).\r\n\r\n#### Release Notes\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n* fix loading shared worker scripts over custom protocol\r\n* fix crash when loading worker scripts with nodeIntegration enabled\r\n",
