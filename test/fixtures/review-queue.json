Probably replacing that with an additional method that sets the flags for a certain extension id and is stored in-memory would be a better approach.\r\n\r\nFixes: #24011.\r\n\r\nConfirmed that react-devtools now works over `file://` if `allowFileAccess: true` is passed and doesn't work otherwise.\r\n\r\ncc @nornagon @samuelmaddock @RangerMauve\r\n\r\nThoughts? It would be helpful to hear which approach should be continued, this one or #25151.\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] PR description included and stakeholders cc'd\r\n- [ ] `npm test` passes\r\n- [ ] tests are [changed or added](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/testing.md)\r\n- [x] relevant documentation is changed or added\r\n- [x] PR title follows semantic [commit guidelines](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/pull-requests.md#commit-message-guidelines)\r\n- [x] [PR release notes](https://github.com/electron/clerk/blob/master/README.md) describe the change in a way relevant to app developers, and are [capitalized, punctuated, and past tense](https://github.com/electron/clerk/blob/master/README.md#examples).\r\n- [x] This is **NOT A BREAKING CHANGE**.

Please provide a description above and review\r\nthe requirements below.\r\n\r\nContributors guide: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSummary: A new \"local\" scheme privilege is added, which grants access to file:// resources without needing to disable webSecurity.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\n- It is common for electron apps to define a custom protocol to serve app resources [(as seen from first example here)](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/protocol).\r\n- Apps that registers their custom protocol as `secure` cannot access files from the `file:///` protocol.\r\n- This rejection comes from deep within chromium and no Electron API seem to be able to override that, except `webSecurity: false`. Things I've tried:\r\n  - `registerFileProtocol('file'...)`\r\n  - `interceptFileProtocol('file'...)`\r\n  - `session.defaultSession.webRequest.onBeforeRequest`\r\n- `webSecurity: false` is not a recommended practice for security purposes by https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/security\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a `local` privilege to scheme registration, which adds the scheme to `blink::SchemeRegistry::RegisterURLSchemeAsLocal`. \r\nDoing so marks the protocol as local, thus allowing it to access local resources via the pathway:\r\n[`SecurityOrigin::CanDisplay()`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:third_party/blink/renderer/platform/weborigin/security_origin.cc;l=417;drc=8d3351f2b93dc4fef60b794c47ec22ebf54f3e8b;bpv=1;bpt=1)\r\n[`SecurityOrigin::can_load_local_resources_`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:third_party/blink/renderer/platform/weborigin/security_origin.cc;l=144;drc=8d3351f2b93dc4fef60b794c47ec22ebf54f3e8b)\r\n[`SecurityOrigin::IsLocal()`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:third_party/blink/renderer/platform/weborigin/security_origin.cc;l=471;drc=8d3351f2b93dc4fef60b794c47ec22ebf54f3e8b)\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.
